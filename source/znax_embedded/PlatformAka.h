//The AKA is an ESP32-S3 at 240 MHz with octal PSRAM, 8 MB of flash and a 320x240 ST7789V.
//Everything goes through the AKA library (components/gamebuino): gb_core for the buttons and
//the joystick, gb_graphics for the drawing and gb_audio_player for the sound. Nothing here
//touches the library's framebuffer or the panel itself, so a change inside the library does
//not reach this port.
//
//The game's 128x128 frame is scaled up to 240x240 in the middle of the display, as on the
//Tufty: 240 / 128 is not a whole number, so a game pixel is 1 or 2 display pixels wide.
//SCALESCREEN 0 shows it 1:1 in the middle instead.
