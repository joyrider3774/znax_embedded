//supplies, the functions are in Platform3DS.cpp.
//
//The 3DS runs the game on an ARM11 at 268 MHz with 128 MB of memory, and has a 400x240 top screen
//and a 320x240 one below it. It is built with devkitARM and libctru, see 3ds/CMakeLists.txt. The
//display class is a small one of its own below, as on the GBA and the DS: it offers the LovyanGFX
//calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX takes them, so the game's LOVYANGFX drawing paths
//work unchanged.
//
//The game is drawn into a screen buffer and that buffer is written to the top screen when the frame
//is done, scaled to 240x240 in its middle, or 1:1 with SCALESCREEN 0. The bottom screen stays dark,
//the game has nothing to put on it.
