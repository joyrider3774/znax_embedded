//supplies, the functions are in PlatformN64.cpp.
//
//The N64 is a 93.75 MHz VR4300 with 4 MB of memory and a display of 320x240 pixels, built with
//libdragon (see n64/CMakeLists.txt). The display class is a small one of its own below, as on the
//GBA and the PlayStation: it offers the LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX
//takes them, so the game's LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.
//
//The game draws into a frame that is kept in the console's own 16 bit pixels, and the RDP puts that
//frame on screen scaled to 240x240 in the middle, or 1:1 with SCALESCREEN 0.
