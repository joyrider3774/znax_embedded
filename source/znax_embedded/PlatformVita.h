//The PlayStation Vita part of Platform.h, included by it. See "The device" in Platform.h for what
//this supplies, the functions are in PlatformVita.cpp.
//
//The Vita is a quad core ARM Cortex-A9 at 444 MHz with 512 MB of RAM and a 960x544 display, built
//with VitaSDK, see vita/CMakeLists.txt. The display class is a small one of its own below, as on the
//PSP: it offers the LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX takes them, so the game's
//LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.
//
//Everything is drawn into a screen buffer, which is copied to the display once a frame: four times
//the size, 512x512 in the middle of the display, or 1:1 in the middle with SCALESCREEN 0. Four is the
//most a 128x128 frame can be blown up on a 544 line display without a pixel bleeding into its
//neighbour, so it is what the frame is scaled by.
