//The Nintendo DS part of Platform.h, included by it. See "The device" in Platform.h for what this
//supplies, the functions are in PlatformNDS.cpp.
//
//The DS runs the game on its ARM9, a 67 MHz ARM946E-S with 4 MB of main RAM and 656 KB of video RAM,
//and has two 256x192 displays of 15 bit pixels. It is built with devkitARM, libnds and calico, see
//nds/CMakeLists.txt. The display class is a small one of its own below, as on the GBA: it offers the
//LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX takes them, so the game's LOVYANGFX drawing
//paths work unchanged.
//
//The game's 128x128 screen is a bitmap background in video RAM, of which there are two: one is shown
//while the other is drawn, so a frame is never seen half drawn. The DS scales that background to
//192x192 in the middle of the top display, or shows it 1:1 with SCALESCREEN 0. The bottom display
//stays dark, the game has nothing to put on it.

//straight into the bitmap that is not on the display, which is the least work per pixel and costs no
//memory of its own. The DS has the RAM for any of the others, but they all mean a second copy of
//every pixel. A build can still set it itself
