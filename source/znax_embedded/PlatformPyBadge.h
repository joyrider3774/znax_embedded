//16 KB, 192 KB of RAM, a 160x128 ST7735R display, QSPI flash for files and the same buttons on
//a shift register. They differ in the d-pad: the PyBadge has buttons on the shift register, the
//PyGamer an analog joystick. The display is driven by Adafruit's ST7735 library, which uses DMA
//on these boards. The class below offers the LovyanGFX calls the game makes on top of it, so the
//game's LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged. The game's 128x128 screen sits in the middle of
//the display.
