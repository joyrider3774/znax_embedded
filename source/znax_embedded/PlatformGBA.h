#ifndef PLATFORM_GBA_H
#define PLATFORM_GBA_H

//The Game Boy Advance part of Platform.h, included by it. See "The device" in Platform.h for what
//this supplies, the functions are in PlatformGBA.cpp.
//
//The GBA is an ARM7TDMI at 16.8 MHz with 32 KB of fast RAM (IWRAM, where the globals live), 256 KB of
//work RAM (EWRAM, where the heap and the big buffers go) and a 240x160 display of 15 bit pixels, built
//with devkitARM and libgba, see gba/CMakeLists.txt. The display class is a small one of its own below,
//as on the PicoSystem: it offers the LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX takes them,
//so the game's LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.
//
//Everything is drawn into a screen buffer. Its changed rows are written to a 160x128 bitmap (mode 5)
//at the start of every vertical blank, and the GBA's own background scaling shows that bitmap at
//160x160 in the middle of the display, or 1:1 with SCALESCREEN 0.

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <string.h>

//the display class offers LovyanGFX's calls, so the game takes its LovyanGFX drawing paths
#define LOVYANGFX 1

//Where drawing goes, the modes are described in PlatformESPboy.h. 8 is the default here: its 16 KB
//buffer fits in the fast IWRAM, which is what keeps the game at its frame rate (Znax: 30 frames a
//second against 20 with a 16 bpp buffer, which is 32 KB and only fits in the slower EWRAM). 8 bpp
//keeps the colours as RGB332, as on the ESPboy. 0 is the default here: the game draws straight into
//the display's pixels in full colour, which is the least work per pixel and needs no buffer memory at
//all. It draws into the page that is not on the display and that page is shown when the frame is
//done, so nothing is ever seen half drawn. A buffer costs a second copy of every pixel and a
//comparison of the whole frame, which on this 16.8 MHz machine is what keeps games from their frame
//rate (Blockdude: 30 frames a second without a buffer against 3.5 with one in the work RAM).
//A build can still set it itself
