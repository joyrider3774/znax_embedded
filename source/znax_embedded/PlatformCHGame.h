//The CHGame part of Platform.h, included by it. See "The device" in Platform.h for what this
//supplies, the functions are in PlatformCHGame.cpp.
//
//The CHGame is Kevin Bates' handheld around a WCH CH32X035G8U6: a QingKe V4C (RISC-V, 48 MHz)
//with 62 KB of flash, of which the USB bootloader keeps the first 12 KB and the game gets
//50944 bytes, 20464 bytes of RAM and a 128x128 ST7735S on SPI1. The board package is
//github.com/bateske/CH32SerialBoot, the display numbers below come from its own graphics
//library github.com/bateske/CHGfx, which is what this panel is known to like.
//
//The game's screen is 128x128 and so is the display, so the picture fills it exactly and there
//is no border to keep black, unlike the Gamebuino META this is otherwise modelled on. Neither
//LovyanGFX nor TFT_eSPI builds on this core, so the display class is a small one of its own
//below, offering the LovyanGFX calls the game makes the way LovyanGFX takes them, so the game's
//LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <string.h>

//the display class offers LovyanGFX's calls, so the game takes its LovyanGFX drawing paths
#define LOVYANGFX 1

//Where drawing goes, the modes are described in PlatformESPboy.h. 20464 bytes of RAM leave room
//for 0 (straight to the display) or a 1 bpp buffer, which is 2048 bytes. An 8 bpp buffer would be
//16384 of the 20464 and leave nothing for the stack, the heap and the SD card, so it is not
//offered. A build can still set this itself.
//Not the 1 bpp buffer here, whatever it would do for how the drawing looks: it holds one bit a
//pixel, so every colour of the four bit skin would come out as one of two. See SetBufferBit in
//Platform.h, and the skin this device builds in FORCESKIN below

#if (SCREENBUFFER != 0) && (SCREENBUFFER != 1)
#error "the CHGame has the RAM for SCREENBUFFER 0 or 1, an 8 bpp buffer would be 16 KB of its 20 KB"
#endif

//Only one skin fits in the flash next to the game: -1 = every skin, n = only skin n, see
//FORCESKIN in defines.h. The four bit skin is the one that is taken: its pictures are packed
//four bits a pixel with a palette of sixteen colours each rather than kept as RGB565, which is
//what makes the game fit at all. Asking for SCREENBUFFER 1 takes the black & white skin instead,
//a 1 bpp buffer holding two colours and no more, and a build can still name any skin itself
#if !defined(FORCESKIN) && (SCREENBUFFER != 1)
//the four bit skin: the default skin's art in sixteen colours, with its five full screen pictures
//left one bit a pixel because at four bits each of those alone is 8232 bytes. See skinDefault4b
#define FORCESKIN skinDefault4b
#endif

//The pixel loops are put in ram rather than run from flash. The core fetches from flash with wait
//states and does not guess at branches, so a short loop with a test in it runs several times slower
//there: the byte swap in writePixels costs about 9 cycles a pixel while the same loops cost 60 to
//110 from flash, for work that is not much different. There is no .highcode section in this board's
//linker script, but .data is loaded into ram from flash at startup, so a function put there is
//copied with it and runs from ram. noinline as well, or a static loop called from one place is
//folded into its caller and lands back in flash with it, the section asking for nothing. Only the
//innermost loops are marked, the ram is needed for the level
