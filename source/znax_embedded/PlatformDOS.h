//Built with DJGPP (see dos/CMakeLists.txt), which makes a 32 bit protected mode program, so the
//game's images are reached as plain memory instead of through the far pointers a 16 bit compiler
//would need. The screen is VGA mode X: 320x240 in 256 colours, which is the mode that has square
//pixels. Plain mode 13h is 320x200 and would show the game a fifth taller than it is wide.
//
//The display class is a small one of its own below, as on the consoles: it offers the LovyanGFX
//calls the game makes, so the game's LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.

//1 = a shade the buffer has no colour for is a pattern of the two nearest ones it does have,
//0 = it becomes the nearer of them, which shows as bands. On here by default: the screen is

//to show on anything that shades. A build can still set it itself, see DITHERING in defines.h
