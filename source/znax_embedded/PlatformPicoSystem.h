//
//The PicoSystem is an RP2040 (two Cortex-M0+ at 133 MHz) with 264 KB of RAM, 16 MB of flash and a
//240x240 ST7789 display, built with the arduino-pico core (Generic RP2040 board, 16 MB flash).
//LovyanGFX's RP2040 support does not build with that core's Pico SDK, so the display class is a
//small one of its own below: it offers the LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX
//takes them, so the game's LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.
//
//With a screen buffer the game's 128x128 frame is scaled up to the whole 240x240 display, SCALESCREEN
//can show it 1:1 in the middle instead. Drawn straight to the display (SCREENBUFFER 0) it always sits
//1:1 in the middle.

//Where drawing goes, the modes are described in PlatformESPboy.h. There is RAM for a full colour
//16 bpp buffer (32 KB of the 264 KB), and only a buffer can be scaled up to the display.
