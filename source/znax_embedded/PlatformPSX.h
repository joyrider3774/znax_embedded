//The PlayStation is a 33 MHz R3000A with 2 MB of memory and 1 MB of video memory, and shows 320x240
//pixels. It is built with PSn00bSDK, see psx/CMakeLists.txt. The display class is a small one of its
//own below, as on the GBA and the DS: it offers the LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way
//LovyanGFX takes them, so the game's LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.
//
//The game is drawn into a screen buffer, that buffer goes into video memory as a texture when the
//frame is done, and the GPU draws it scaled to 240x240 in the middle of the screen, or 1:1 with
//SCALESCREEN 0.

//draws into a frame that is already in the GPU's own colours, so only what changes is touched and

//every frame is converted instead, which this 33 MHz machine feels. A build can still set it itself
