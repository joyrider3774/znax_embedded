//The TinyCircuits Thumby Color part of Platform.h, included by it. See "The device" in Platform.h for
//what this supplies, the functions are in PlatformThumby.cpp.
//
//The Thumby Color is an RP2350A (two Cortex-M33 at 150 MHz) with 520 KB of RAM, 16 MB of flash and a
//0.85" 128x128 GC9107 display on SPI. It builds with the arduino-pico core as its Generic RP2350
//board with the RP2350A chip variant. LovyanGFX's RP2040 support does not build with that core's
//Pico SDK, so as on the PicoSystem the display class is a small one of its own below: it offers the
//LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX takes them, so the game's LOVYANGFX drawing
//paths work unchanged.
//
//The display is 128x128, the size of the game's own screen, so the frame is always shown 1:1 over
//the whole display and there is nothing to scale or centre.
