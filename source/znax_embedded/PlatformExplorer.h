//The Explorer is an RP2350B (two Cortex-M33 at 150 MHz) with 512 KB of RAM, 16 MB of flash and a
//320x240 ST7789 display on an 8 bit parallel bus, built with the arduino-pico core (its Pimoroni
//Explorer board). LovyanGFX's RP2040 support does not build with that core's Pico SDK and has no
//parallel bus for it either, so as on the PicoSystem the display class is a small one of its own
//below: it offers the LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX takes them, so the
//game's LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.
//
//With a screen buffer the game's 128x128 frame is scaled up to 240x240 in the middle of the display,
//SCALESCREEN can show it 1:1 in the middle instead. Drawn straight to the display (SCREENBUFFER 0)
//it always sits 1:1 in the middle.
