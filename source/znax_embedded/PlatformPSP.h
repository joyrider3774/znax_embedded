//this supplies, the functions are in PlatformPSP.cpp.
//
//The PSP is a MIPS Allegrex at 222 MHz (333 with the clock raised) with 32 MB of RAM and a 480x272
//display, built with the pspdev toolchain, see psp/CMakeLists.txt. The display class is a small one of
//its own below, as on the GBA: it offers the LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX
//takes them, so the game's LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.
//
//Everything is drawn into a screen buffer, which is copied to the display at the start of every
//vertical blank: doubled to 256x256 in the middle of the display, or 1:1 in the middle with
//SCALESCREEN 0. Doubling is what fits a 128x128 frame on a 272 line display without blurring a pixel
//into a neighbour, so it is what the frame is scaled by.
