//The game as a libretro core, a shared library RetroArch and the other libretro frontends load and
//run on every system they run on. Built with libretro/CMakeLists.txt. The frontend calls the core
//once per frame and does the rest: scaling the 128x128 picture, input devices, sound output and
//writing the save file. The display class is a small one of its own below, as on the PicoSystem: it
//offers the LovyanGFX calls the game makes, the same way LovyanGFX takes them, so the game's
//LOVYANGFX drawing paths work unchanged.
//
//Everything is drawn into a screen buffer, which is handed to the frontend as RGB565 pixels at the
//end of every frame.
