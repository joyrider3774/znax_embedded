//Platform.h for the CHGame, Kevin Bates' CH32X035 handheld. Built with its board package
//(github.com/bateske/CHGame, 0.3.0 or later), using the Arduino core with its SPI library for the
//display and the board's CHGame library for the buttons and the sound:
//  display  ST7735S 128x128 on SPI1, chip select PA4, data/command PB0, reset PB12
//  buttons  one GPIO each, pulled up and low while held, set up and read by the CHGame library
//  sound    the buzzer on PB10, played by the CHGame library's sound engine, see the sound further
//           down
//  saves    a flash page the bootloader leaves alone, see the saved data further down
//
//The display numbers are the ones CHGfx (github.com/bateske/CHGfx) uses for this panel, which is
//the library written for this board: MADCTL 0xC8 with the picture starting at column 2, row 3.
//
//Buttons: d-pad, A, B, SELECT = left side button, START = right side button.
//
//Two traps of this chip, both of which CHGfx documents and both of which this file stays clear of
//by going through the core rather than the registers:
//  - GPIOB's CFGHR is write only. Reading it back does not return what was written, so the core
//    keeps a RAM shadow and a raw write behind its back is undone by the next pinMode on any pin
//    of that half of the port. Every pin here is set through pinMode and digitalWrite
//  - the reset line drifts below its threshold if it is left alone for about a second, and the
//    panel then takes that for a reset and blanks to white while the game carries on drawing into
//    it. It is driven high again on every window change, which is four instructions against the
//    eleven SPI transfers that follow it

// Saved data
//
// The part has no EEPROM the game can use: its own library stores into the option bytes and holds
// 26 of them, where the game's block is PLATFORM_STORAGE_SIZE. What it does have is flash the
// bootloader leaves alone. The bootloader erases only the pages a new sketch occupies, so the
// pages between the end of the image and the metadata page at 0xF700 come through an upload
// untouched, and the game's block lives in one of those. This is what CHBlackjack does.
//
// Two pages are written in turn, each record stamped with a magic value, a version, a sequence
// number that counts up and a CRC over everything before it. Whichever page reads back valid with
// the higher sequence number is the newest save, so a power cut part way through a write can lose
// at most the save being made and never the one before it. Where the image reaches into the first
// of the two pages only the second is used, and where it reaches into both, saving turns itself
// off rather than write over code.
//
// The whole block is kept in RAM as well and that is what the game reads, so a load costs nothing
// and a write only happens when something actually changed.
//
// The magic value is the game's own. Every game of this kind keeps its save in the same two pages,
// and CHGame's SD card menu installs a game by writing only the pages its image needs, so the
// save of the game that was on before is still there when the next one starts. With one magic
// for all of them a game took another's block for its own; the magic is made from the first word
// of the name Platform_Init gets (the version after it changes from build to build, the game does
// not) and CHGAME_SAVE_VARIANT, which a build of one level pack of a game sets so that each pack
// keeps a save of its own.
